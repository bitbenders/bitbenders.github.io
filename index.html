        <p class="body">According to the USDA, the average cost to raise a child up to the age of 17 is $233,610 [16]. Raising a child can be expensive. We want to design a better way for mothers of babies and toddlers to lower their living costs through a shared community of other mothers for this project. Oftentimes motherhood communities are centered around children and how their needs can be fulfilled, and thus catering to the needs of the mother is oftentimes neglected [17]. It is crucial that we understand and explore the needs of mothers with young children without only focusing on their children. Making sure the needs of a mother are met can ensure that a child’s needs can efficiently be met as well.</p>
